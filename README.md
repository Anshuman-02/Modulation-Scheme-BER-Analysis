# Modulation Scheme BER Analysis

This project analyzes the Bit Error Rate (BER) for different modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM) in MATLAB. It demonstrates the impact of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) on the performance of each modulation scheme without the use of error-correcting codes.

## Key Features:
- BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM modulation schemes.
- Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is used for simulating noisy channels.
- BER is calculated and plotted against SNR for each modulation scheme.

## MATLAB Code:
- `modulation_scheme.m`: Main script for BER analysis and plotting results.

## How to Run:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the MATLAB script `modulation_scheme.m`.
3. Run the script to generate BER vs. SNR plots for each modulation scheme.

## Requirements:
- MATLAB (R2020 or later recommended)
- Communications System Toolbox

## Results:
The script produces a plot showing the BER for different modulation schemes against varying SNR values.
